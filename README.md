## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Preparation 📂

### Dataset Preparation

1. **Load the Video**: Extract frames from the video.
2. **Convert Frames**: Save frames as grayscale images and `.npy` files.
3. **Extract Images and Labels**: Organize images and labels into separate `.npy` files.

Ensure that you have the dataset organized and stored correctly before proceeding to the next steps.

## Model Building 🔧

1. **Define the Generator Model**: Build the architecture of your generator model. This includes setting up layers and configurations required for image generation.
2. **Define the Discriminator Model**: Set up the architecture of the discriminator model to classify generated images as real or fake.

## Training 🏋️

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Batch and shuffle your dataset to feed it into the models.
2. **Train the Model**: Use your prepared dataset to train the generator and discriminator models.

Monitor the training process and adjust hyperparameters as needed to improve model performance.

## Usage 🎯

1. **Generate Images**: After training, use the generator model to create new images from random noise.

Test the generator to ensure it produces high-quality images.
